# Early_Detection_Of_Parkinsons_Disease
I developed an IoT-ML solution for Parkinson’s detection using an IMU sensor to capture 3D motion data. Trained on a research-based dataset, our ensemble model achieved 98% accuracy. The app processes sensor data to detect Parkinson’s effectively.

Working: 
1)IoT : We have used an IMU sensor that detects temperature,acceleration and gyroscopic measurements in 3D . The data is displayed in the IDE’s Serial Monitor.
2)ML : The data set chosen here is taken from a well-known research paper. Binary Classification Trained on an ensemble of models. Got performance metrics 98% accuracy
3)APP : The data of the accelerometer and gyroscope is registered. The model is run through it. Therefore, detecting if the person is suffering from parkinson’s or not.
